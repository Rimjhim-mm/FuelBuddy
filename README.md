# FuelBuddy

This application was created when an intention of using various popular tools like firebase, application development using android studio, google map API's and cloud :D

The mobile application is developed to serve as a user-friendly platform designed to streamline all fuel-related needs. In its current iteration, the app tries to offer real-time navigation capabilities through the integration of the Google Maps API, allowing users to effortlessly locate the nearest gas stations or EV charging points based on their current location. 

Additionally, the application delivers the latest news and updates related to fuel trends, policies, and market changes, keeping users informed about developments that may impact their fuel choices or expenses. 

To ensure secure and seamless access, the app employs Google Firebase for authentication, managing login and registration processes with robust security measures to safeguard user data and provide a hassle-free onboarding experience.

Looking ahead, the application is set to incorporate real-time data integration for regional fuel prices in its upcoming updates. This enhancement will allow users to make informed decisions by comparing fuel costs across different locations. 

Currently in its testing phase, the application addresses any potential issue, and optimize its overall user experience. These efforts aim to deliver a polished and reliable tool that meets the diverse fuel-related needs of its users




The code can be run locally normally. However the assets are required for better experience.
Also since this is my first attempt at android developement, the api is best handled at my local machine.
